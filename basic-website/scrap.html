    <h1>Lessons from A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</h1>

    <p>
        "Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts, and thoughts result in action." These words by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam remind us that everything great starts with a dream. Without a vision, there is no direction, and without action, dreams remain just fantasies.
    </p>

    <p>
        "All of us do not have equal talent. But, all of us have an equal opportunity to develop our talents." Dr. Kalam believed that hard work, dedication, and perseverance are more powerful than natural talent. With consistent effort, anyone can achieve greatness.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough." Dr. Kalam encouraged everyone to embrace failures as stepping stones to success. Each failure teaches a valuable lesson and builds resilience for the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        "If you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun." He believed that success comes through intense effort and sacrifice. To achieve excellence, one must be willing to endure hardships and stay committed to their goals.
